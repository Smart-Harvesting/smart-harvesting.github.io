This repository contains the static files and assets for the project website.

:warning: Do not change the files manually. Instead, follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/Smart-Harvesting/website/blob/master/README.md) to update the website via Jekyll.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: The `docs` folder with the empty `CNAME` file, as well as the `.nojekyll` file in root are needed to get GitHub Pages to display this website correctly.
